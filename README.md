## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at TU Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Gabriele Steidl.

My interests lie in optimal transport, primarily in Wasserstein gradient flows, and in kernel methods.
I am currenly learning more about metric gradient flows for other metrics, e.g. Fisher-Rao.

Here you will find the code for the following projects.
* [Wasserstein Gradient Flows of Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces](arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613)
